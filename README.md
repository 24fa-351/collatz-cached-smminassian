So lets understand how you run this program:

Type in your command line:

./collatz cachesize N min Max modeChecker

The reason why i have cachesize here is because before i hardcoded it and I was running into issues with mruCount. 

Also the reason why I have modeChecker there is to determine if you are using MRU or LRU

Type 1 in terminal if you are using LRU and 2 if MRU

If you want to get the values that i got on my sheet, you need to run it in power shell. I think the reason why I was getting different values on wsl is because i was using a different seed.
